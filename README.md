#Example using jQuery.Deferred

This (admittedly non-exhaustive, possibly trite) example gives a simplified example of using jQuery.when().then().then().etc.etc.done() to explore resolve/reject behavior.

##Usage
Just clone the repo and do:

    npm install

The main dependency for this project is [jquery-deferred](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jquery-deferred), available on npmjs.org.

There aren't many dials to turn in the code.  It's mainly a sandbox for futzing around with running a set of deferred objects and modifying things in code.

When you've installed the project, just do:

    node ./

... and you should see some output.

##Conclusion
Feel free to contribute changes, corrections, and/or any freaky combinations of when/then/done chainings that expose fun or weird behavior.
